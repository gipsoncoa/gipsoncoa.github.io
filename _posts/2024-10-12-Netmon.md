Netmon serves as a brilliant example of being very intentional and simple when looking for vectors to enumerate and services to exploit. I spent time going down a rabbit hole, albeit a shallow one, but the lesson was learned. It's also important to take very copious notes in these reports here, so from now on these will be very fleshed out.

```

The scan gives us quite a bit. We've got access to FTP shares, a PRTG Monitor version 18.1.37.13946, and SMB. In hindsight, it's very simple and quite concise, so the trained eye merely comes from practice.

### Service Enumeration

Take the path of least resistance. Be water. Let's fucking go, yeah? Starting with FTP is the sensical choice, with anonymous login allowed, we're privy to quite a bit.

Initially, I'd completely skipped this vector... Dunno why.  `ftp anonymous@10.10.10.152` will yield access. Now, from now on, where applicable, `ls -la` takes precedence. This shows hidden directories, if any. 

```

We get a lot here, but we don't know what it all means yet. Easiest path leads us down through public users to get our user flag.

```
ftp> more user.txt
0526c34b6f2df988e87b2d8d1abc7b4b
```

Theres nothing much else here in the `/Users` directory, and we cannot access administrator level ones without higher privileges. We'll come back here soon. Let's see what the web server has to offer.

Navigating to the website, we're met with a portal for this PRTG Network Monitor, and upon some research looking for version information and credentials, we find this interesting tidbits.

So, it looks like this version of the software keeps plaintext credentials in an old configuration file, and given the path in the photo, it looks like we can access through FTP. Navigating to `/ProgramData/Paessler/PRTG\ Network\ Monitor/` gives us access to the old configuration files, where we can find the credentials needed.

### Initial Access

Now, once found, we can use searchsploit to check if there's a MSF module for the RCE referenced above. 

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/li0t]
└─# searchsploit PRTG
------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                             |  Path
------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

PRTG Network Monitor 20.4.63.1412 - 'maps' | windows/webapps/49156.txt

PRTG Traffic Grapher 6.2.1 - 'url' Cross-S | java/webapps/34108.txt
------------------------------------------- --------------------------------
```

Looks like we're in business. I'm going to use Metasploit for now because I'm pressed on time, but I'll come back through (for all MSF ones) and do it manually as well.

```

```

Looks like 3 is what we want. I'll also set to a `bind_tcp` payload, as reverse has been throwing errors for me. Also, the box was published in 2019, and seeing as the password houses 2018, we can give both a shot for variance.

Let it rip, bear.

### Post-Exploitation

Navigate to the administrator file that we didn't have access to before, and you'll get your flag.

```
meterpreter > cat root.txt
