Lame is a very simple and easy box detailing the importance of SMB enumeration, and how to capitalize on said enumeration with metasploit. Let's get to it.

There are a good amount of options here for enumeration. We've got FTP via vsftpd 2.3.4, we've got OpenSSH 4.7p1, amd some SMB shares. Ideally, we'd go through each, but SMB is the answer here, and we'll keep it concise.

### Initial Access

Researching this version of Samba 3.0.20, we come across a CVE-2007-2447, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell meta-characters involving the `SamrChangePassword` function, when the "username map script" smb.conf option is enabled. We can search metasploit modules for an answer and come up with one:

`use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script`

Looking at our options, it's imperative to set LHOST as our tun0 address and not our eth0. This threw many errors and is worth consideration in the future. 

Parameters, otherwise, are set as normal.

### Post Exploitation

We can do what we've done before, and cd straight to home directory for our user flag. Then, we can navigate to the root folder for our root flag.

`USER:1d4a90b8ef1da1772cad2ef968d96bad`

`ROOT:e82a028aebebb3f5c28034f9561ba802`
