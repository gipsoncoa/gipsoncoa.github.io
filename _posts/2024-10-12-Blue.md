Blue is perhaps the most trademarked and popular box on the platform, and for good reason. It's a very easy and simple setup meant to test the attacker's understanding of metasploit, CVE research, and basic linux commands. There is no better place to start, so why don't we?

Our NMAP scan gives us solid information. We've got host names, remote procedure call (RPC) ports, etc. The gem here lies in the smb scripts NMAP has run for us! We can see an outdated version of Windows 7, and upon further research, can recognize the vulnerability in MS17_010 or Eternal Blue. This will be our attack vector.

# Initial Access

In order to press on, we need to fire up msfconsole, and search for our proper exploit.

`search exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` 

Once found, we can configure out options to reflect:

`RHOSTS: 10.0.10.40`
`RPORT: 445`
`LHOST: 10.0.2.15`
`LPORT: 4444`

Additionally, the `reverse/tcp` recommended payload kept throwing errors for me, so I opted for a `bind_tcp` meterpreter session instead.

`set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp`

This yields a shell:

Now, we need to root around for a flag. Use `pwd` and `ls` to scope surroundings, and use `cd ../` to backtrack out of the nonsense. Once the users directory is found, navigate towards the desktop, where the flag resides. I'll let you grab these for yourself!
