Hey, what's up? My name's Coleman.

This blog is really a tool to consolidate my notes and findings while I learn new things. I'm currently a student, and this serves as an archive that I can reference in the future. I hope that if you've stumbled your way here, it can help you as well!

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
- **Penetration Testing**: Techniques, tools, and walkthroughs
- **Vulnerability Research**: Identifying and analyzing security flaws
- **Tools & Tutorials**: Guides for tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and more

## Philosophy
I believe penetration testing resembles an art, and I try to treat it at such.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy hacking!
